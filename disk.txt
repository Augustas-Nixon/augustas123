seek time
Seek Time is defined as the time required by the read/write head to move from one track to another.

Rotational Latency:
The time required by the read/write head to rotate to the requested sector from the current position is 
called Rotational Latency.

Transfer Time: Transfer time is the time to transfer the data. It depends on the rotating speed of the disk
and number of bytes to be transferred.

 Disk Access Time = Seek Time + 
                         Rotational Latency + 
                         Transfer Time

Disk scheduling
Disk scheduling is done by operating systems to schedule I/O requests arriving for the disk. 
Disk scheduling is also known as I/O scheduling.

FCFS: FCFS is the simplest of all the Disk Scheduling Algorithms. In FCFS, the requests are addressed 
in the order they arrive in the disk queue

SCAN: In SCAN algorithm the disk arm moves into a particular direction and services the requests coming in its path
and after reaching the end of disk, it reverses its direction and again services the request arriving in its path.

CSCAN: In SCAN algorithm, the disk arm again scans the path that has been scanned, after reversing its direction. 

why disk sceduling is imporatnt
Multiple I/O requests may arrive by different processes and only one I/O request can be served at a time by the disk controller. Thus other I/O requests need to wait in the waiting queue and need to be scheduled.
Two or more request may be far from each other so can result in greater disk arm movement.
Hard drives are one of the slowest parts of the computer system and thus need to be accessed in an efficient manner

structure
A magnetic disk contains several platters. Each platter is divided into circular shaped tracks. 
The length of the tracks near the centre is less than the length of the tracks farther from the centre. 
Each track is further divided into sectors
