Deadlock
Deadlock refers to the condition when 2 or more processes are
waiting for each other to release a resource indefinitely.

Conditions for Deadlock
mutual exclusion-resources cannot be shared
hold and wait-processes request resource incrementally,and hold on to what they've got.
no pre-emption-resource cannot be forcibiliy taken from processes
circular wait-each process is waiting for a resource held the next process in the chain.

Deadlock Avoidance
Deadlock avoidance can be done with Bankerâ€™s Algorithm.
The request will only be granted under the below condition:

If the request made by the process is less than equal to max need to that process.
If the request made by the process is less than equal to the freely available resource in the system.


Recovery method
Killing the process: killing all the process involved in the deadlock. Killing process one by one. 
After killing each process check for deadlock again keep repeating the process till system recover 
from deadlock.

Resource Preemption: Resources are preempted from the processes involved in the deadlock, 
preempted resources are allocated to other processes so that there is a possibility of recovering the system 
from deadlock.
